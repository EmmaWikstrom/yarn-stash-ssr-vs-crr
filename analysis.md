# Comparison: Server-Side Rendering vs Client-Side Rendering

## Performance

In the SSR version, all content is included directly in the HTML file. This allows the browser to render visible content immediately after parsing the HTML. As a result, the time to first visible content is shorter.

In the CSR version, the initial HTML file is almost empty. The browser must first load and execute JavaScript before generating and inserting the content into the DOM. This adds an extra step, which increases the time before the user sees any content.

## SEO

In the SSR version, all content is present in the initial HTML file. This means search engines can access the content directly when the page is loaded.

In the CSR version, the main content is generated by JavaScript after the page loads. This means the content is not available in the initial HTML response. Because of this, SSR provides more immediate and predictable access to content for search engines.

## User Experience

In the SSR version, the user sees the content immediately. Only images may load slightly after the initial render.

In the CSR version, the page initially appears empty until JavaScript runs and renders the content. This can create a short delay or flicker effect, especially on slower connections.
